## another cheap way of doing FTP Transfers


</div>

### Description

Actuall this is probably the CHEAPEST ftp client in the world :) Dont get me wrong, i did this for joking around, and it's definately NOT the way to do it, but it might give some ideas for doin some other stuff.

Actually this prog uses the ftp.exe that ships with win98 an NT and feeds it command line parameters and reads results out of a file. It can PUT,GET files, and list files in distant directories, check it out and laugh your a** of :)
